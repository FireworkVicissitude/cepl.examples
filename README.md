# Cepl.Examples

Examples showing some aspects of the cepl library.

It's tricky to demo CEPL as it doesnt aim to dictate to heavily how you will do things, this means that things such as defining how you define/manage your 'entities' or even how you define a camera are pretty much left up to you.

To that end we have one possible camera implementation in `examples/helpers/camera.lisp`, it this is the one we use in many of the examples.

It's a bit all over the place but will be cleaned up eventually.

# WARNING

Currently requires the `feature-errors` branch of CEPL. This note will be removed once that branch is merged so it's best to wait until then :)
