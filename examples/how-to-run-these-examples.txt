How to run the examples
=======================

* Load slime
* Load cepl with: (ql:quickload :cepl)
* Create a opengl context with (cepl:repl)
* Compile the example and then in the repl evaluate (run-loop)
* use (stop-loop) to stop the demo, this is the safe way as clicking 
  the 'x' on the window will destroy the context and possibly the
  current lisp session.
