# How to run the examples

* Load slime
* Load the example system with: (ql:quickload :cepl.examples)
* Start a cepl session with (cepl:repl)
* Compile the example
* in the repl make sure you are in the correct package and then evaluate (run-loop)
* use (stop-loop) to stop the demo, this is the safe way as clicking
  the 'x' on the window will shut-down the current cepl session.
